# Ebay-Shill-Bidding-Prediction
The main goal of this project is to use classification algorithms to predict shill bids in the future. 

1. Introduction
In this project, I will be working with the dataset Shill biddig available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset.

Customers throughout the world have the option of bidding on eBay. A 'bid' is the price offered by anyone participating in this procedure. Shill bidding occurs when a seller deliberately inflates the final price of his or her auction by faking bids. In the data set, normal bids are labelled as '0', while abnormal bids are labelled as '1'.

The main goal is to use classification algorithms to predict bids in the future. The difference between regression and classification models is the nature of the dependent variable which can be qualitative, in the case of classification, and continuous in the case of regression. (Stéphane Tufféry, 2011)

For this purpose, I will divide this project into Data Understanding, EDA, Data Preparation, PCA vs LDA, Class Imbalance, Modelling, Comparation between models chosen and Conclusion.
